# DAC-CSR 

Matlab Implementation for Dynamic Attention-Controlled Cascaded Shape Regression (DAC-CSR)

## News

* I will squeeze my time to tidy, document and upload the code as soon as possible.
* 2017-05-07: Add results/*.fig files for the results on the AFLW and COFW datasets. You can open them using Matlab and add your results for comparison.

## Installation

### Download the code and dataset
1. Clone the repository as well as the submodules to `/pathtomaindir/` using `git clone --recursive`.
2. Download the AFLW dataset from `https://www.tugraz.at/institute/icg/research/team-bischof/lrs/downloads/aflw/` and uncompress it to `/pathtomaindir/aflw/data`.
3. Download the AFLW-FULL protocol data from `http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/compositional/AFLWinfo_release.mat` and put the file under `/pathtomaindir/aflw/`.

### Run test on AFLW using the pre-trained model 

### The training code is coming soon...
